# Security Policy

Thank you for privately reporting security issues!

If you have found a security issue, please open a draft advisory at https://github.com/minrk/findspark/security/advisories .

Once you create a draft advisory, we will work together to:

1. confirm the issue (and close the advisory if none is found)
2. prepare a fix
3. publish the fix to PyPI
4. notify tidelift (package security sponsor)
5. publish advisory, once the fix is widely available (up to 7 days after release, depending on severity)
